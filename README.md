# decicive
This repository was created by cloning legacy decision support system implementation. Application is developed as rich WPF client that based on Wolfram Mathematica ans Wolfram Alpha math engines. 
Future steps for application refactoring:
1. Get rid of Wolfram Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha engines dependencies. Use instead C# based math libraries Accord.NET or Math.NET Numerics
2. Reimplement front-end client as React application
3. Extract all business logic from rich client and cover it with ASP.NET Core web application
